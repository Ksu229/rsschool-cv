## ABOUT ME
Eight years ago I gratuated from the Univesity with a degree in economics. 
When I was studying I familiarized myself with the computer programming. It was a part of our studying.
But we learnt very little about it because it wasn't our main purpose.
After the University I worked for a large enterprise in St P as an accountant. Three years ago I was taken up the posirtion of a deputy chief accountant for taxation. 


Now I have some free time so I'd like to try myself in a new professional field. I get pleasure from studying something new. It's a great challenge for me. 
I'm able to work under pressure and I have attention to details. I'm friendly, polite, responsible, reliable and quick-minded.
